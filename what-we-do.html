							<p>Group support, we at YAFA fully support members of the community to form social groups/clubs and have allowed these groups to use the nu base booking to establish these gatherings. For example, we currently have a women's club that meets every Saturday evening, a men's mental health group that meets every Thursday evening, a girls club and a youth club, a number of breakfast groups, we support a very successful basic english classes for BAME women and we also established GCSE Support for young people. We' re always happy to support community initiatives as this is one of our core reasons for setting up the charity. So if you have an idea and need advice and guidance and a facility to deliver the project, please get in contact.</p>
                            <h3 id="education">EDUCATION AND TRAINING</h3>
							<p>English classes for women is one of our most successful projects. We have one qualified English teacher, teaching two classes a week, one beginner/basic level and the other intermediate level; however, class sizes are limited to approximately 14 students. All the women are from the BAME community of Netherthorpe and Upperthorpe.</p>
                            <p>The B.O.A.T offers short course English classes for all individuals'. Courses are designed for all ages and abilities. We offer alternative ways of learning. For more information click <a href="files/BOAT FLYER JUNE 2021.pdf" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p>
